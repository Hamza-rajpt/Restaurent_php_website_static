				Almost all countries actively deny civil rights to some minority groups. Because civil rights are enforced by countries, it is difficult to establish an international standard for civil rights protection, despite the efforts of international governance bodies such as the United Nations. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948, includes civil rights language but is not binding on member states. Civil rights tend to increase as governments feel pressure, either from national movements or other countries, to enact change.

				Asma Jilani Jahangir (ASMA  JAHANGIR; 27 January 1952 – 11 February 2018) was a Pakistani human rights lawyer and social activist who co-founded and chaired the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan.Jahangir was known for playing a prominent role in the Lawyers' Movement and served as the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief and as a trustee at the International Crisis Group
		<br><br>
				In the early 1980s, Asma, her sister, Hina Jilani, along with two other friends, started a law firm, thus starting Pakistan’s first all-women law firm.

Though the 18-year-old failed initially as the court dismissed her petition, she won after approaching the Supreme Court. When her father was released, she got her first taste of victory in the court of law.
		<br><br>
				Though Asma was initially taking up family cases, it was not long before she realised that the only way to change the status quo was not by fighting individuals but by taking on institutions and bringing in societal reforms. So she started fighting against misuse of power, all kinds of blasphemy laws that Pakistan has, and criticising the military...
