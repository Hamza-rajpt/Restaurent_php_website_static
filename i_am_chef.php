			<h1>
				We believe in artisan food and the small producer.
			</h1>
			<p>
				Each meal, when made on a small scale and with fresh ingredients, is like a rescue to  the cozy moments  we have had in our lives, those that are increasingly rare today when we talk about food.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our chefs are inspired artists, they are real people! Each one works on their own schedule and offers their production according to their availability. Our chefs go on vacation, respect the seasonality of ingredients and the pace of real life.Technology is virtual, but relationships are personal!
			</p>
		
			<h3>
				WE ARE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR TALENTS IN EVERYTHING WHERE WE WORK AND OUR MISSION IS TO FIND THEM, PROMOTE THEM AND BRING THEM TO CUSTOMERS!
